- Build a system for making Node.js applications fault-tolerant, perhaps using some form of replicated execution.
- Build a data-processing system that is good at both big data (like MapReduce and Spark) and on-line processing (like a key/value store or SQL database).
- Build a data-flow processing system in the style of Google FlumeJava or Spark or Naiad.
- Build a system with asynchronous replication (like Dynamo or Ficus or Bayou). Perhaps add stronger consistency (as in COPS or Walter or Lynx).
- Build a coherent caching system for use by web sites (a bit like memcached), perhaps along the lines of TxCache.
- Build a distributed cooperative web cache, perhaps along the lines of Firecoral or Maygh.

Execute your project: design and build something neat!
Write a document describing the design and implementation of your project, and turn it in along with your project's code by the final deadline. The document should be about 3 pages of text that helps us understand what problem you solved, and what your code does. You can either send the code to the staff list or provide a link to an repository (e.g., on GitHub) in your writeup. The code and writeups will be posted online after the end of the semester.
Prepare a short in-class presentation about the work that you have done for your final project. We will provide a projector that you can use to demonstrate your project.

Flesh out the exact problem you will be addressing and how you will go about solving it. By the proposal deadline, you must submit a proposal (less than a page) describing: your group members list, the problem you want to address, how you plan to address it, and what are you proposing to specifically design and implement.
