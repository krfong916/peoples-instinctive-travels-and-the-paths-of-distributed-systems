# 👣 Peoples Instinctive Travels And The Paths of Distributed Systems

This is a repo for distributed systems. It contains my notes, reviews, and project ideas.

## 🛠 Contributing

Still in the process of thinking how I'd like people to contribute/collaborate to this repo.
Here are a few interesting thoughts:

- Implement the flavors of Paxos and use Jepsen testing framework + Open-Loop testing environment w/injection of partial network failures
- Reimplement Professor Kuper's paper "Verifying Replicated Datatypes with Typeclass Refinements in Liquid Haskell" but in Liquid Rust
- Secure document storage with an e2e encryption protocol, X3DH, something by way of Signal and WhatsApp, with ABAC architecture. Abstract to a framework.
- Create a SAT solver from scratch

If you have ideas, shoot me an [email 📧](mailto:krfong@ucsc.edu?subject=[Distributed-Systems-Repo])
