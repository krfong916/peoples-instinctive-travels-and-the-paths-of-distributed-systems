❗❗❗ I am taking a brief break from distributed systems, I will resume activity on May 15th, 2021 ❗❗❗

# 👣 Peoples Instinctive Travels And The Paths of Distributed Systems

This is a repo for distributed systems. It contains my notes, reviews, and project ideas.

## 🛠 Contributing

Still in the process of thinking how I'd like people to contribute/collaborate to this repo.
Here are a few interesting thoughts:

- Implement the flavors of Paxos and use Jepsen testing framework
- Belief States and Formal Verification of a program... with energy grid and mission critical applications

If you have ideas, shoot me an [email 📧](mailto:krfong@ucsc.edu?subject=[Distributed-Systems-Repo])
